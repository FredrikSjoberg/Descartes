###Descartes

=========

Descartes is a Âµ-framework written entirely in Swift and loosely focused on Computational Geometry. It implements some concepts, methods and algorithms I find useful or interesting.

Features:
- Voronoi (Voronoi/Delaunay dual graph)
- Perlin (Perlin noise in 1, 2 and 3 dim)


Voronoi:
The Voronoi class implements Fortune's algorithm (Steven Fortune, 1994)
TODO: Usage

Perlin:
Swift implementation of Ken Perlin's noise function (1, 2 and 3 dim)
TODO: Usage

Please note: This is in no way production ready. Consider this a "proof of concept", nothing else. Testing has been sparse.
